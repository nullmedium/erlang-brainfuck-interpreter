== A Brainfuck Interpreter written in Erlang ==

Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language noted for its extreme minimalism. The language
consists of only eight simple commands and an instruction pointer. It is designed to challenge and
amuse programmers, and was not made to be suitable for practical use. It was created in 1993 by
Urban MÃ¼ller. (Source: Wikipedia)

This interpreter supports all eight instructions as well as nested loops. You can
feed it a file with brainfuck code mixed with comments. It will execute the commands
and ignore everything else.
